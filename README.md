Revenue report dashboard for DTLM retail store
This dashboard was created using Microsoft Excel, the dataset was gotten from the sales data of DTLM Retail store which consists of sales table, sales team, products and store locations each stored on a seperate sheets.

The sales director requested for the following from the data analysts; The Revenue and Profit, A report of the the revenue trend, the top 5 customers by revenue, the revenue contribution of the product categories, top 10 sales team by revenue, top 10 states by revenue, also the population and median income per state, A dashboard with the reports.

Data modelling was carried out and relationship was created using Foreign key and Primary Key across each table in diiferent sheets. I used vLookup to bring in some of the columns in the seperate sheets into the sales table sheet to make it easier for my pivot chats. I also created some calculated columns for better analysis. 
I created pivot tables and charts each of the sales director request. I created a report that the sales director can easily understand, I used line chart to show the revenue trend and also made the dashboard and report sliceable by product category and timeline.

Finally, I included a text box to hightlight the following insights; the top two revenue products in January? Which sales team made most revenue from Decoratives in March? and the relationship between revenue, population and median income of the states.![DTLM Retail Dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29276051/212036525-53ad90fd-fafb-4f15-b725-4ded51818c4b.png)
